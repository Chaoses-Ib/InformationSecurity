# Sanitization
**Sanitization** is the process of removing sensitive information from a document or other message (or sometimes encrypting it), so that the document may be distributed to a broader audience.

- When the intent is secrecy protection, such as in dealing with [classified information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information), sanitization attempts to reduce the document's classification level, possibly yielding an unclassified document.
- When the intent is privacy protection, it is often called data anonymization.
