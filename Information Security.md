[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)

**Information security (InfoSec)** is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information.

Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.[^wiki]

Objects:
- CIA
  - Confidentiality (保密性)  
    Confidentiality is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.[^wiki]
  - Integrity (完整性)  
    Integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.[^wiki] The information cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
  - Availability (可用性)  
    For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed.[^wiki]
- Non-repudiation (不可否认性)  
  The information's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract.

  Availability measures the ability of a piece of equipment to be operated if needed, while reliability measures the ability of a piece of equipment to perform its intended function for a specific interval without failure.[^upkeep]
- Auditability (可审计性)
