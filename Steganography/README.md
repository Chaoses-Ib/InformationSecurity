# Steganography
**Steganography** is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.[^wiki]

## Steganalysis
**Steganalysis** is the study of detecting messages hidden using steganography; this is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to cryptography.[^steganalysis]
